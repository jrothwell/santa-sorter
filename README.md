# Santa Sorter

## To run

Set up this project in your favourite IDE (I recommend IntelliJ) and run SantaSorterApp with the arguments `server {config.yml}`, where `{config.yml}` is a config file (there is an example config.yml in the root of the project.) Look at the Dropwizard documentation for more info.

You will need a running MongoDB instance on your computer.
